To get the app running, you will need to edit the following files to customize everything for your environment:

    config/environment_custom.rb
    config/database.yml
    config/newrelic.yml       (if you want performance metrics from NewRelic)
    config/twitter.yml        (if you want Twitter integration)
    config/facebooker.yml     (if you want Facebook integration)

To customize the UI, edit / create files in the following directories:

    app/views/custom/
    public/stylesheets/sass/
    public/images/

UI elements that pertain to your brand need not be contributed back to the open source project.

==================

To set up the database, if you are using MySQL, you'll need to make sure the user configured in database.yml
has permission to use the "load data" command:

    grant file on *.* to bbyidx;

To set up the database:

    rake db:create   # if you haven't created it already through your DB admin tool
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed

Now fire up the app!

    script/server
    
You'll be prompted to create a superuser account, and then you're ready to go.
    
To verify the code you checked out, and to test changes:

    rake test
